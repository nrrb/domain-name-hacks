Domain Hacks
============

[Wikipedia][0]: 

There are already a few domain name search tools that aid in finding domain hacks:

* [xona][1]
* [domaintyper][2]
* [domainhack.me][3]

My impression of domain hacks is that the name has nothing to do with what the company or individual does. At best, it's a stretched metaphor. The only reason I have [goggl.es][4] is because it was the first word that popped into my head looking at the TLD list on [namecheap][5] that was available and not too expensive. If I had a tool that showed me a few different ideas, I bet I'd find one that I liked even more.
