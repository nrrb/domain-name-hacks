Domain Hacks
============

[Wikipedia][0] says: 

A domain hack is a domain name that suggests a word, phrase, or name when concatenating two or more adjacent levels of that domain. For example, http://grou.ps/, http://fold.it/, and http://goo.gl/ suggest the word groups, the phrase fold it and the name google, respectively. In this context, the word hack denotes a clever trick (as in programming), not an exploit or break-in (as in security).

What is this drivel?
--------------------

There are already a few domain name search tools that aid in finding domain hacks:

* [xona][1]
* [domaintyper][2]
* [domainhack.me][3]

There appears to be [an auction site][7] for very popular domain hacks. A lot of the names have capitalization; as far as I know, domain name resolution is case insensitive, so this doesn't matter. 

My impression of domain hacks is that the name has nothing to do with what the company or individual does. At best, it's a stretched metaphor. The only reason I have [goggl.es][4] is because it was the first word that popped into my head looking at the TLD list on [namecheap][5] that was available and not too expensive. If I had a tool that showed me a few different ideas, I bet I'd find one that I liked even more.
